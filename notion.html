  <h1>George Costanza Feedback Bot Demo</h1>

  <h2>Background Info</h2>
  <p>
    George Costanza currently serves as the Assistant to the Traveling Secretary for the New York Yankees, a role he has held for several years.
    In this position, George is responsible for managing all travel logistics for the team, including booking flights and hotel accommodations,
    coordinating ground transportation, and ensuring travel documentation is in order. He works closely with external vendors, hotel managers,
    and the team’s front office to facilitate seamless travel during the MLB season.
  </p>
  <p>
    George’s day-to-day responsibilities also include preparing and reconciling expense reports, responding to last-minute changes or emergencies
    in the travel schedule, and maintaining detailed records of each trip. He serves as a liaison between the front office and team operations staff,
    helping translate logistical needs into actionable plans. Although not a public-facing figure, George plays a key behind-the-scenes role
    in keeping operations running smoothly.
  </p>
  <p>
    While George is technically competent in many aspects of his role, he often struggles with self-confidence and decision-making under pressure.
    He can become defensive when challenged and sometimes avoids taking initiative unless directly prompted. However, he is loyal to his team
    and values being part of a high-profile organization. George prefers structure and predictability, and he performs best when his responsibilities
    are clearly defined and expectations are well communicated.
